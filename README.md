Wasabi Sushi Website Project
Overview: 
This is my first website project, created as part of my design studies. Using Bootstrap, I built a simple, responsive website for a fictional sushi restaurant, Wasabi Sushi. While still learning, I aimed to create a basic site that showcases the restaurant's menu and history while offering a clean, easy-to-navigate experience.

Features: 
Front Page: A basic introduction to the restaurant with an image of sushi and a navbar.
About us: A quick little decription about the restaurant and the history of it. 

Menu Page: A simple layout displaying the restaurant's sushi dishes with images and basic details.
Order Food Page: A form for users to place orders, designed to be straightforward and functional.


Design: 
I focused on keeping the design clean and minimalist, with a simple color scheme of green, white, and black. I made sure the layout was easy to follow, with the goal of creating a welcoming and simple online experience for users.

Technologies Used
Bootstrap: To make the site responsive and mobile-friendly.
HTML & CSS: To build the basic structure and layout.
JavaScript: To add a little interactivity. 
Adobe Photoshop: For creating visuals and images used on the site.

Objective
This project was a learning experience for me, helping me understand the basics of web design, responsive layouts, and using Bootstrap. Itâ€™s a simple attempt to showcase my work while I continue building my skills in web development.
